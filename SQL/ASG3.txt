1) Does ANSI recognize the data type DATE?
âœ… Yes, ANSI (American National Standards Institute) recognizes the DATE data type.

In ANSI SQL, DATE is a standard data type used to store date values (like '2025-04-10').

It typically stores the year, month, and day, but not the time part (which is handled by TIME or DATETIME/TIMESTAMP depending on the DBMS).
